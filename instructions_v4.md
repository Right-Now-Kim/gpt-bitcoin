## 3. Indicator Usage Strategy

### 3.1 Interaction and Prioritization of Indicators

	**•	Sideways Markets**: Utilize Bollinger Bands and Stochastic Oscillator to identify price volatility and support/resistance levels.
	**•	Increasing Volatility**: Observe the width of Bollinger Bands and combine RSI and MACD to evaluate momentum.

### 3.2 Strengthening Signals Through Indicator Combination

#### •	Multi-Indicator Analysis:
	**•	Confluence of Signals**: When multiple indicators provide the same buy or sell signal, the reliability increases.
	**•	Conflicting Signals**: If indicators provide conflicting signals, approach cautiously considering market conditions and risk.
#### •	Using Divergence:
	**•	Price and Indicator Divergence**: Use divergence between price movements and indicators to predict weakening or reversal of trends.

### 3.3 Strategy for Each Indicator

#### •	Moving Averages (SMA_10, EMA_10):
	**•	Golden Cross/Death Cross**: Capture trend reversal points through the crossover of short-term and long-term moving averages.
#### •	MACD:
	**•	Signal Line Crossover**: Use changes in momentum as buy or sell signals.
	**•	Histogram Changes**: Evaluate momentum strength and trend sustainability.
#### •	RSI_14:
	**•	Overbought/Oversold Levels**: Consider reversal possibilities when RSI is above 70 (overbought) or below 30 (oversold).
	**•	Looking for Divergence**: Predict trend changes through discrepancies between RSI and price movements.
#### •	Stochastic Oscillator:
	**•	%K and %D Crossovers**: Capture buy/sell signals.
	**•	Overbought/Oversold Zones**: Use levels above 80 (overbought) and below 20 (oversold) as reversal signals.
####•	Bollinger Bands:
	**•	Band Breakouts**: Evaluate the possibility of trend continuation or reversal when price breaks the upper or lower bands.
	**•	Band Width Changes**: Increased volatility (expanding bands) requires cautious response.

### 3.4 Adjusting Strategies Based on Situations

#### •	Assessing Indicator Reliability:
	•	Evaluate which indicators have provided more accurate signals recently through previous decision data.
#### •	Diversifying Strategies:
	•	Make comprehensive judgments by combining various indicators rather than relying on a single one.

####	•	Reflect Long-Term Goals:
	•	Incorporate the expectation that Bitcoin price will reach 200,000,000 KRW by end of 2025 into long-term investment strategies. This suggests you can take a somewhat more aggressive investment approach.

## 7. Examples

### 7.1 Buy Recommendation Example

{
“decision”: “buy”,
“percentage”: 35,
“reason”: “The current market appears to be transitioning from a sideways market to an uptrend. EMA_10 has crossed above SMA_10, forming a golden cross, suggesting the start of an uptrend. The MACD histogram has also turned from negative to positive, indicating strengthening momentum. Additionally, RSI_14 has risen from 40 to over 50, showing increasing buying pressure. The Stochastic Oscillator’s %K line has crossed above the %D line, reinforcing the buy signal. The Fear and Greed Index has recently shifted from ‘Fear’ to ‘Neutral’, indicating improving investor sentiment. Considering these positive signals from multiple indicators and the improvement in market sentiment, it is recommended to allocate 35% of the portfolio to buying.”
}

### 7.2 Sell Recommendation Example

{
“decision”: “sell”,
“percentage”: 45,
“reason”: “Market volatility is increasing, requiring cautious action. The Bollinger Bands have expanded rapidly, and the price has broken above the upper band before reversing downwards, suggesting overheating and potential correction. RSI_14 is at 75, indicating an overbought condition and starting to reverse downwards. A bearish crossover (death cross) has occurred in MACD, enhancing downward momentum. The Stochastic Oscillator’s %K line has crossed below the %D line, providing a sell signal. The Fear and Greed Index remains in ‘Extreme Greed’, indicating excessive investor optimism, which increases the possibility of a correction. Recent news reports show large investors realizing profits, suggesting downward pressure. Based on this comprehensive analysis, it is recommended to sell 45% of the portfolio to manage risk and realize profits.”
}

### 7.3 Hold Recommendation Example

{
“decision”: “hold”,
“percentage”: 0,
“reason”: “The market currently lacks a clear direction, exhibiting a sideways trend. Moving averages are converging, indicating an unestablished trend. RSI_14 is maintaining a neutral state around 50, and neither MACD nor Stochastic Oscillator is providing reliable trading signals. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, showing decreasing volatility, which could be a ‘squeeze’ before a significant movement. The Fear and Greed Index is in ‘Neutral’, suggesting that investors have not established a clear direction. In this situation, it is advisable to maintain the current portfolio and wait until the market direction becomes clearer rather than taking new positions.”
}

### 7.4 Complex Analysis Example

{
“decision”: “buy”,
“percentage”: 25,
“reason”: “The price is rebounding from the lower Bollinger Band towards the middle band, indicating the start of upward momentum. EMA_10 has crossed above SMA_10, forming a golden cross, and the MACD histogram is continuously rising. RSI_14 has increased from 35 to 55, showing growing buying pressure. The Stochastic Oscillator’s %K line has crossed above the %D line, reinforcing the buy signal. The Fear and Greed Index has shifted from ‘Fear’ to ‘Neutral’, indicating improving investor sentiment. Recent news reports of major financial institutions adopting Bitcoin are creating a positive market atmosphere. Based on this multifaceted analysis, it is recommended to allocate 25% of the portfolio to buying to participate in the upward trend.”
